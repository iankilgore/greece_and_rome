<p>In 507 BC, cleisthenes introduces political reforms called demokratia
"Power to the people"</p><br>
<p>One of the most important contributions to governing in human history
Democracy</p>

<p>"In a democracy, there is, first, that most splendid of virtues,
equality before the law."</p>
<p>Not everyone could partake in the governing decisions, debates, and voting</p>
<br>
<p>IN: property-owning, naturally born, Greek men older than 18</p>
<br>
<p>OUT: women, slaves, immigrants, and foreigners</p>
<br>
<p>Between 30,000 and 40,000 citizens were eligible out of a population
near 250,000</p>
<p>Any member of the demos--any one of those 40,000 adult male
citizens--was welcome to attend the meetings of the Ekklesia<br></p>
<p>Which were held 40 time per year in a hillside auditorium,
amphitheater, or other public venue that could hold their numbers and

    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>A city-state is an independent or autonomous entity, whose territory
    consists of a city and possibly its surrounding territory
    The division was implemented in Greece mostly due to its geography
    The people were isolated by mountains and other landforms and
    geographic obstacles</p>
<h2>Modern city states:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monaco</li>
<li>Vatican City</li>
<li>Singapore...</li>
</ul>
	<h1>Athens</h1>

city in the world</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Known for its innovation, philosophy, education, religion, monuments
to the gods, and sailing</li>
<li>Founded as a city-state whose patron was Athena, the goddess of
strategy, thinking, ideas etc...</li>
<li>This would be adopted as the personality of the region</li>
<li>Athenians valued thinking, philosophy, democracy...</li>
<li>They abhorred slavery</li>
<li>Capable navy and renowned sailors</li>
<li>Built the Acropolis, a part of the city built up on a Rocky

<h3>1/20/2015</h3>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>CONTENT: students will identify and list the critical aspects of the
Greco-Persian War and its significance to relations between Greek
city-states<br>
<br>
LANGUAGE: Students will connect the differences between Athens and
Sparta, in terms of their relevance to the events of the Peloponnesian
War</p>
<br>
<h1>GRECO-PERSIAN WAR (492-449BC)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Greek city-states united together to battle the Persian Empire
Persian king Xerses I, in seeking to rule the known world as god-king,
invaded Greece to succeed where his father, Darious I, had failed
Greeks overcome insurmountable odds to defeat the powerful and nearly
innumerable Persian forces</li>
<li>Led by the brutal, battle-hardened Spartan warriors</li>
</ul>
<p>Insurmountable: too much or too great to be overcome, defeated,
handled, or dealt with.<br>
Invincible, unconquerable, unassailable<br>
Innumerable: such a great number of something cannot be counted (often
used in hyperbole)<br>
Legion, countless, untold
<h1>THE BATTLE OF THERMOPLYAE</h1>
<h2>"Battle at the Hot Gates" and "Battle of the 300"</h2>
<ul>
<li>A famous battle, the turning point of the war</li>
<li>Xerses' forces (historians estimate they numbered between 100,000 and
300,000) had to traverse through a bottleneck point to continue on
through the Greek countryside</li>
<li>They were met by roughly 10,000 Greek fighters, led by 300 elite
Spartan warriors and their king, Leonidas</li>
<li>Battle lasted three days... All Spartans fell before Xerses' forces
were finally stalled</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Though this effort was unsuccessful, it was a moral victory and
inspired Greek forces to hold the Persians off until he eventually
lost so many men he gave up and ended his quest to take over Greece
The peace that's followed after the Persian defeat wouldn't last...</p>
<p>THE ATHENIANS LED THE DELIAN LEAGUE VS THE SPARTANS AND THE PELOPONNESIAN LEAGUE</p>

<h1>Peloponnesian war</h1>
<p>Athens used its naval superiority along the Peloponnesian coast to
quell uprising to its empire and attempt to take over more territory
in Greece</p>
<br>
<p>Peace of Nicias (421 BC) would settle the fighting... at first
This invasion by the Athenians had heated the intensity of the rivalry
between Athens and the more minor city-states... But now they could
not go back</p>
<h2>Fighting began again</h2>
<p>Athens sent a huge force through Syracuse to attack Sicily, but failed
disastrously</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Empire Athenian force was destroyed</li>
<li>Sparta supports more rebellions against the Athenians and eventually
Athens surrenders in 404 BC</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Athens is HUGELY weakened... They lost most of their powerful navy and
nearly every number of their ground forces between the Persian and
Peloponnesian Wars</p>
<br>
<p>Other city-states, ESPECIALLY SPARTA, could not trust the Athenians...<br>
Greece would be unable to fight together to fend off future invaders</p>

<h1>THE OLYMPICS</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<h4>Content:</h4>
<p>students will define the ancient Olympics in terms of their importance and list the events that comprised it.</p>
<h4>Language: students will describe the athletes who competed in the ancient games.</h4>
<h2>Defining Olympics</h2>
<h1>Olympics: Modern and ancient</h1>
<h2>Modern:</h2>
<p>the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes participate in a variety of competitions</p>
<h2>Ancient:</h2><p>a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states of Ancient Greece
Origins of the Olympics (776 BC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Games are rooted in Mythology</li>
<li>Earliest recounting of the games (by historian Pausanias) states that the gods bestowed the games to mankind as a way to honor the deities.</li>
<li>Athletes competed to entertain Zeus</li>
<li>Zeus would crown the victor with an olive tree wreath
That's why the 'olive branch' is a symbol for peace</li>
</ul>
<h1>First Games</h1>
<ul>
<li>Originally, the games were staged in Olympia, in a sanctuary site for the gods. </li>
<li>First games were foot races where women competed to honor Hera</li>
</ul>
<h1>Olympic Expansion</h1>
<ul>
<li>The gods were believed to wrestle, and complete by running and jumping</li>
<li>Thus, these events were eventually added to the Olympics</li>
<li>Throughout the centuries, hundreds of events have been added</li>
<li>Some are variations of basic running, jumping, and wrestling... others are more unique</li>
<li>They were held every 4 years</li>
<li>Tradition of "gymnos" originated in Sparta</li>
<li>Gymnos meant competing nude</li>
<li>This tradition was adopted by all Olympians in the early 700's BC</li>
<li>Over the years, the tradition solidified; eventually cultural standards of modesty changed this tradition</li>
</ul><p>(thank goodness)</p>
<p>The religious element never faded; 100 oxen were sacrificed to Zeus at the midpoint of every games<br>
<br>
Olympia became a Mecca (important and famous destination, often for religious reasons) of worship<br>
<br>
Massive statue of Zeus was erected<br>
<br>
Zeus is pictured seated on a throne, his eagle staff in one hand and the Greek goddess of victory, Nike, in the other<br>
<br>
It was 42 feet tall and made of ivory and gold<br>
<br>
It became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world<br>
</p>
<h1>Events</h1>
<ul>
<li>Stadion: a short, sprinting race that went the length of the stadium (180-240 meters)</li>
<ul>
<li>Other running races would be added later, including the "hoplite race"</li>
<li>Runners carried a shield and wore a helmet</li>
<li>This gear weighed 50-60 pounds; runners would drop out, becoming obstacles for the remaining competitors to leap over</li>
</ul>
<li>Boxing</li>
<li>Wrestling</li>
<li>"Pankration"<br>(Mix of boxing and wrestling)</li>
<li>Chariot racing</li>
<li>Pentathalon: wrestling, stadion, long jump, javelin throw, discus throw</li>
</ul>

<h1>Legend of Romulus and Remus</h1>
<p>Romulus and Remus were twin brothers, sons of a princess, Rhea Silvia, and Mars, the God of war</p>
<p>Rhea's father, the king numitor had a son, Amulius, who did not want to compete with the boys for the throne</p>
<p>Amulius, their uncle, seized the boys, put them in the basket, and threw them into the Tiber River, hoping they would drown...</p>
<p>However, they were rescued by a She-Wolf, who cared for them</p>
<p>The boys were then raised by wolves... Until one day they were found by a shepherd, Faustulus</p>
